## Architectural Decisions

This project uses the following architectural principles:

- **Next.js Framework**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and ease of use for building modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
- **Modular Components**: The application is structured with reusable and maintainable components.
- **API Routes**: Built-in API routes are used for server-side logic.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The application assumes a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
- It is designed to run locally or on a Node.js-compatible hosting environment.
- Some features may require specific environment variables to be set in `.env.local`.
